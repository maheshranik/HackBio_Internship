###NGS Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline built using the Nextflow workflow management system. The pipeline automates a series of steps typically involved in the processing and analysis of raw sequencing data, from quality control of the raw reads to identifying genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions and deletions (indels).
