**NGS Analysis Pipeline**

This repository contains a comprehensive Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline built using the Nextflow workflow management system. The pipeline automates a series of steps typically involved in the processing and analysis of raw sequencing data, from quality control of the raw reads to identifying genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions and deletions (indels).

**Overview of the Analysis Pipeline**

    **Input:** The input to the pipeline is raw paired-end sequencing data in FASTQ format. These are the unprocessed sequencing reads that typically result from a DNA sequencing experiment, such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or targeted sequencing projects.

    Quality Control (QC): The first step is to assess the quality of the raw sequencing reads using FastQC. Quality control is crucial because raw sequencing data may contain low-quality reads, base-calling errors, or adapter sequences that can negatively impact downstream analyses. The pipeline generates detailed QC reports that summarize important metrics such as per-base sequence quality, sequence length distribution, GC content, and the presence of adapter contamination. These reports help identify whether any preprocessing is required.

    Trimming and Filtering: After quality assessment, the pipeline uses fastp to trim adapter sequences and remove low-quality bases from the raw reads. This step is necessary to eliminate technical artifacts and low-confidence bases that could interfere with alignment and variant calling. Additionally, paired-end read integrity is ensured, which means that both reads in a pair are kept in sync after trimming. The trimmed reads are then passed to the alignment stage.

    Read Repair (Optional): In some cases, paired-end sequencing data might have discrepancies, such as missing reads in one of the pairs. The pipeline uses BBTools (repair.sh) to fix such discrepancies, ensuring that all read pairs are synchronized and properly formatted before proceeding to the alignment stage.

    Alignment to Reference Genome: The next step is to align the trimmed reads to a reference genome using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner), a widely-used tool for aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome. This process matches the sequencing reads to their corresponding locations in the reference genome, producing a SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) file. Alignment is essential for identifying the genomic regions from which the sequencing reads were derived.

    Conversion to BAM Format: SAM files, which store alignment data, are converted to BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) format, a compressed binary version of the SAM file that is easier to handle and requires less storage space. The pipeline uses Samtools for this conversion. BAM files are the standard format for storing aligned sequences.

    Sorting and Indexing: The BAM file is then sorted based on genomic coordinates, and an index is created for fast retrieval of data from the file. Sorting and indexing are crucial for improving the efficiency of downstream analyses, particularly when dealing with large datasets.

    Variant Calling: Once the reads have been aligned to the reference genome, the pipeline uses Bcftools to identify genetic variants. Variant calling detects differences between the aligned sequencing data and the reference genome, including SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), insertions, deletions, and other genomic variations. The output of this step is a VCF (Variant Call Format) file, which contains the raw variants identified in the dataset.

    Variant Filtering: Raw variant calls often include false positives or low-quality variants. The pipeline applies various filtering criteria to the raw variants, such as minimum quality score, read depth, and variant allele frequency, to generate a high-confidence set of variants. The filtered variants are output in a final VCF file, ready for downstream analyses such as population genetics studies, association studies, or clinical interpretation.

    Output: The pipeline produces several output files at each step, including:
        QC reports: Detailed quality control reports from FastQC.
        Trimmed reads: Cleaned and filtered sequencing reads after trimming.
        Aligned reads: BAM files containing the aligned reads.
        Variant calls: VCF files containing the raw and filtered variants.

Flexibility and Customization

The pipeline is designed to be highly customizable. Users can modify:

    Trimming parameters (e.g., minimum quality threshold, adapter sequences) depending on their specific dataset.
    Variant filtering thresholds (e.g., quality score cutoff, read depth) to fit different types of studies or projects.
    Reference genome used in alignment, allowing the pipeline to be applied to different species or different versions of a reference genome.

Applications

This pipeline is widely applicable in various NGS analyses, including but not limited to:

    Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for identifying genome-wide variants.
    Exome sequencing for identifying variants in coding regions.
    Targeted sequencing for focusing on specific genomic regions of interest.
    Microbial genomics for studying microbial populations or pathogen genomes.
